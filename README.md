## About 

This game is a frogger clone. The goal is to get your character from the bottom of the screen to the water at the top. Each time you get a character to the water you will get 5 points. If you run into one of the bugs you will loose 2 points and 1 life. You have 4 lives, once you are out of lives its game over. Try to get as many points as you can before you run out of lives.

## Contributing

Since this was made for a project I will not be taking any contributions to this project.

## TODO

* Add more enemies the higher the score gets or the more times you get to the water
* Add Collectables that give you more points.
* Add hearts that give you back lives
* Show current lives
